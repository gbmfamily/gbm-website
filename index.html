  <h2>Statement of Purpose</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      To lead men to be genuinely born again, saved from sin, bondage to idolatry,
      false religion, selfishness, corruption, and all that debars men from heaven
      through the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    </li>
    <li>
      To build men up to spiritual maturity and Christ-likeness at home, at work,
      in society, and in the house of God through the indwelling power of the Holy
      Spirit.
    </li>
    <li>
      To lead men to walk in dominion over every demonic influence and power
      through the supernatural power of God, enjoying the full benefits of the
      gospel.
    </li>
    <li>
      To train and equip men to fulfill the Great Commission of evangelizing the
      world for Christ and receiving eternal reward.
    </li>
    <li>
      To plant Acts-of-the-Apostles churches (Grace Bible Churches) across the
      world, beginning from Osogbo and spreading through Osun State, Nigeria,
      Africa, and the world.
    </li>
    <li>
      To prepare men without spot or wrinkle for the glorious appearing of our
      Lord Jesus Christ, that they may enjoy the Kingdom of God forever.
    </li>
    <li>
      To glorify God in worship, in ministry, and in all that we do.
    </li>
    <li>
